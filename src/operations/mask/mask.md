## Parameters
- `shift ends`: shifts the position of the ends in draft b relative to a
- `shift pics`: shifts the position of the pics in draft b relative to b

## Application
No established application, but a fun way to see how to apply binary math to the production of drafts. Retains input draft b in regions where input draft a has raised warp ends (black cells); draft b is only retained within the area of draft a.
