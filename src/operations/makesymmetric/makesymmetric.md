## Parameters
- `options`: a list of options for 4-way and 2-way symmetry. Each option specifies the corner that will become the center of the design when rotated
- `center repeat removed?`: in some cases where designs are pointed, the rotational duplicates the final point of the design. You can remove the center end or pick to preserve pointed structures. 

## Application
to create structures with rotational symmetry
