## Parameters
- `ends`: the number of ends wide to make the resulting structure
- `amplitude`: the number of picks tall for this structure. We use the term "amplitude" here to align with the conventional naming for sine functions
- `frequency`: the frequency of a wave, such as a sine way describes the number of times the wave travels over and under its midpoint in a given time span. In music, this frequency results in a tone but in this function, it results in the interlacements being described along the amplitude.


## Application
While not an established weaving technique, the production of sine waves can produce really interesting threading and treadling patterns.
